### Overview
Arduino-controlled precise temperature regulation system using Peltier modules to maintain vaccine storage within the WHO-recommended cold range of 2–8°C in remote or off-grid locations. 

## Validity
Tested with hardware components, system successfully maintained the target temperature range (set to room temperature for proof of logic) during trial runs.
